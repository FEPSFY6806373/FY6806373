           this article explores the evolution of the air defense system proposed by Ronald Reagan, as part of the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) program. The air defense shield proven
           to be one of the most successful throughout the program, has faced both victorious triumphs as well as challenging set backs, all touched on closely throughout the discussion. 
           Furthermore, it dips into ideas of the implication of fiction on future developments and it calibrates a bridge between current and upcoming reality. </p>

     <p class="ex1">
    <p style="font-family:Helvetica Neue;font-size:110%;text-align:justify;margin-left:110px;margin-right:110px;">The Iron Dome Shield is an air defense system currently only used by Israel.
      It was introduced by Ronald Reagan in the 1980’s under the programme SDI and it was labeled as a far-fetched “Star Wars” dream by the critics <a href="#Gutfeld, 2017">(Gutfeld, 2017)</a>. The SDI program stands for
      Strategic Defense Initiative and had the plan to develop a space-based missile defense program that could intercept large nuclear attacks from other countries <a href="#Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) 1983, 2009">(Strategic Defense Initiative
      (SDI), 1983, 2009)</a>. The title of SDI was used for various projects within the program including the Iron Dome Shied System. It being one of the most successful parts of the program.

   <p class="ex1">
  <p style="font-family:Helvetica Neue;font-size:110%;text-align:justify;margin-left:110px;margin-right:110px;">
The Iron Dome is located on the ground, and consists of three main parts, the radar system, the control system and the launcher <a href="#BBC, 2023">(BBC, 2023)</a>. The way it works is by having
    an overview of the Israeli sky. The radar system identifies and tracks the missiles and the rockets sent by other countries towards Israel, the control system then calculates an estimated point
    of impact for the missiles and its approximate trajectory. Finally, the launcher fires its own missile towards the rocket to intercept it causing an explosion in the air and neutralising the
    attack <a href="#BBC, 2023">(BBC, 2023)</a>. Statistically speaking, the Iron Dome Shield has stopped around 90% of the missiles and rockets shot towards Israel <a href="#BBC, 2023">(BBC, 2023)</a>. This high percentage of success has been 
    saving many innocent lives in Israel and it continues to do so today. Since 2011, when the shield first started operating, up until 2021, it stopped and destroyed approximately 1500 rockets
    <a href="#An assessment on Israel's 'Iron Dome' Defense System, 2021">(An assessment on Israel's 'Iron Dome' Defense System, 2021)</a>. In 2023 alone, the iron dome shield has stopped over 2000 and overall since it started operating, it has stopped approximately 9500 
    rockets <a href="#Frantzman, 2023">(Frantzman, 2023)</a>.   </p>
    <img style="margin-left:400px;" src="irondome1.png.webp" alt="IronDome" width="500" height="400">
     <p style="font-family:Helvetica Neue;font-size:105%;text-align:justify;margin-left:450px;margin-right:250px;"> Figure 2: Iron Dome System diagram (BBC, 2023) </p>
    
     <p style="font-family:Helvetica Neue;font-size:110%;text-align:justify;margin-left:110px;margin-right:110px;">Some advantages of using the Iron Dome System are that more lives are saved, 
       less territory is being destroyed by incoming rockets, the number of soldiers sent out in war are decreasing so fewer deaths are occurring. However, one of the greatest advantages is that the
       project works all the time. Having this possibility, the Iron Dome is always prepared for any attack, and therefore, the country is always defended. This 24/7 system has improved the safety
       of the country and reduced the number of deaths caused by attack missiles <a href="#NEXT IAS Content Team, 2023"> (NEXT IAS Content Team, 2023)</a>. Another good factor of the Iron Dome is that the country is indeed protecting itself, 
       through its own system, without asking for additional help from other governments. The system is indeed run by the United States and distributed to Israel, however when it was first proposed by 
       Ronald Reagan it was developed for Israel specifically, therefore no other governments besides these 2 have been implicated in the development of the system. Other countries such as the UK, Finland, 
       Slovakia, and Canada have been purchasing components of the system or the whole entire system, where other nations such as South Korea, Romania and Azerbaijan have expressed interest in buying parts of 
       it <a href="#Mordowanec, 2023"> (Mordowanec, 2023)</a>.  </p>

      <p style="font-family:Helvetica Neue;font-size:110%;text-align:justify;margin-left:110px;margin-right:110px;">Unfortunately, just like any other defense system, the Iron Dome Shield also has 
        some disadvantages. One of the major ones being the debris left behind after the Israeli missile intercepts the attack rocket. If the attack rocket has not been destroyed into very small 
        pieces, the debris left behind can easily fall through the air, and hit people, their home, workspace, or belongings and still cause impactful damage to their lives <a href="#NEXT IAS Content Team, 2023"> (NEXT IAS Content Team, 2023)</a>. 
        Other issues with the Iron Domes include that the system is not always successful, although it has stopped high numbers of missiles, it has not stopped all of them and there is never a certainty that
        the shield will stop all future attacks. The possibility of having some rockets still hitting the country causes a psychological stress on the population of the country and on the Iron Dome itself
        as it can never be predicted when it will fail or if it will fail <a href="#An assessment on Israel's 'Iron Dome' Defense System, 2021">(An assessment on Israel's 'Iron Dome' Defense System, 2021)</a>. </p>
    
     <p style="font-family:Helvetica Neue;font-size:110%;text-align:justify;margin-left:110px;margin-right:110px;">One important aspect to mention is that the Iron Dome system is expensive. Israel currently
       has 11 batteries, and each missile has costed $60,000 which is £47,300, so intercepting thousands of rockets will quickly add up to a considerable sum <a href="#Berlinger et al., 2023">(Berlinger et al., 2023)</a>. Compared to an attack
       missile which costs around $600, the intercepting rockets costs about 50 times more, making it a significant impact on the economy and the income of the country <a href="#Boyd, 2023">(Boyd, 2023)</a>.  </p>
   </p>

    
    <h3 style="font-family:Helvetica Neue;font-size:40px;text-align:justify;margin-left:150px;margin-right:150px;" id="Conclusion"><b>Conclusion</b></h3>
   <p class="ex1">
    <p style="font-family:Helvetica Neue;font-size:110%;text-align:justify;margin-left:110px;margin-right:110px;">
Overall, the Iron Dome air defense system, being one of the most advanced ones to exist, has stopped many deaths, has improved the quality of life, and
made a major difference in the country’s and people’s livelihood. However, the shield is not invincible, with time, other countries will develop their
attack systems to be able to overcome the Iron Dome air defense system. As technology is developing itself, the Iron Dome will also be forced to develop
into a newer, better version, or even be combined with fictional ideas, to be able to prevent disasters, which the current air defense system would not
be able to withstand. With time, implementing fictional ideas into the current fundamentals of the Iron Dome, will successfully expand the coverage of
the program worldwide leading to less casualties and improving the safety of the war zone in question.
