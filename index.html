          The unfortunate growth of wars throughout the years, have led to necessary improvements in the attack or defense systems of 
        countries. Using the current fundamentals behind the air defense system of iron domes, combined with a fictional background, an
        alternative proposal is introduced. The collaboration between the reality of the existing iron dome and the fiction of the Korean
        drama ‘Gird’ desires the safety of people, their homes, environment and ultimately their country.

         Living in a time where wars start by one country sending a missile at the other and attack systems have been strongly developed,
      the iron dome shield system is one of the most advanced airs defense systems which can be taken as an example in protecting the
      country’s population.[1] By using the theory behind iron domes and its mechanisms, combined with fictional ideas inspired by the
      Korean drama “Grid”,[2] the defense system of countries in war zones could improve greatly and lead to less deaths and less destruction
      over territory.

        The iron dome shield is an air defense system currently only used by Israel. It was introduced by Ronald Reagan in the 1980’s under 
      the name of SDI and it was labeled as a far-fetched “Star Wars” dream by the critics [3]. The system is located on the ground, and 
      consists of three main parts, the radar system, the control system and the launcher. The way it works is by having an overview of the
      Israeli sky. The radar system identifies and tracks the missiles and the rockets sent by other countries towards Israel, the control
      system then calculates an estimated point of impact for the missiles and its approximate trajectory. Finally, the launcher fires its
      own missile towards the rocket to intercept it causing an explosion in the air and neutralizing the attack.[4] Statistically speaking,
      according to BBC the iron dome shield has stopped around 90% of the missiles and rockets shot towards Israel [5].

        After watching the fictional Korean drama “Grid”, I thought the ideas used in the show could be implemented in the system of the
      iron dome shield for a higher chance of protection of the countries in war zones. The sci-fi show is about how the earth is protected
      from solar winds through a grid which surrounds the planet in space. [2] Although the protective shield surrounds the earth and it is
      covering the whole planet from space, I believe if the approach were to be reduced to a smaller scale, it could be introduced onto
      Earth instead of outside it. Implementation of this idea into the iron dome defense system would increase the area currently covered
      by the radar, raising the shield higher in the air, but also giving a longer time for the attack rockets to be destroyed. The idea is
      that the missile is destroyed as soon as it comes into contact with the shield protecting the sky of the country. 
      (Introduce picture of the gird and explain it)

        The proposal of the new alternative of iron domes would start off by positioning devices in the stratosphere above the war zone in
      question. Depending on the size of the country, more or less devices will be needed. The devices would consist of taking and operating
      the current iron dome system into air instead of ground, without having to manually access it. The machines would be spread equally
      above the country’s sky, from one end of the boarders to another. These devices would be linked between each other, creating something
      like an invisible arch over the country’s sky. This arch is what would protect the country from attack missiles and rockets, by
      destroying the attack as soon as it comes into contact with the arch. If this proposal is to be put into practice, the devices should
      not reach higher than the end of the stratosphere, such that planes would still be able to fly in and out the country. Still, exact
      heights of position have to be calculated, considering the devices themselves are not reachable by the attack missiles or that the
      rockets can enter the country, while bypassing the arch. Some advantages of changing the internal structure of the iron dome shield
      would include decreasing the risk of rockets and missile debris touching the ground and falling from the sky, hurting people. Higher
      chance of success and a less overwhelmed radar system as the rockets will not have to be tracked anymore if the shield fully covers
      the war zone. The shield would work best over a smaller area as not as many satellites would be needed to cover the whole sky above
      the country.

        Currently this is a very theoretical idea, and I haven’t found sources to say governments are planning to increase the coverage
      of the iron dome radar or to make changes within the system. However, I choose to bring this idea forward as something that could be
      worked on in the future and which could be tested out to see if there is any possibility for it to work. According to the news on the
      ongoing war between Palestine and Israel, the US is planning to send more iron domes to Israel as seen on the news report on the
      defensenews website [6]. However, these iron domes are just the same as the regular ones, there have been no changes made.
